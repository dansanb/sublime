# Daniel's Sublime Text 3 Configuration

All Sublime Text 3 settings and keyboard bindings are stored in the User folder. This is also where package control stores all plug-ins installed. The user folder is located here on Mac OSX:
```
/Users/daniel/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/User
